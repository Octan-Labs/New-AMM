# New AMM protocol with near-zero Impermanent Loss
Impermanent Loss (IL) and slippage are inherent properties of all existing AMM models derived from Uniswap's constant formula. Although many improvements have been introduced to concentrate liquidity (or increase capital efficiency), hence reduce slippage. No project deals with impermanent loss which all liquidity providers (LPs) is suffered. LPs only expect accumulated trading fee can cover greater than their loss for long-term investment. 

New AMM protocol aims to eliminate Impermanent Loss by bringing beautiful properties of Limit Order Book (LOB) into liquidity curves, i.e. re-design the conventional AMM models applying on Uniswap, Balancer, and other spot-DEXes. Our solution is based on three major tactics:
- Inventory control in traFi and Uniswap model.
- Price reversals similar to tradFi which is not available in Uniswap.
- Manage V-shape LOB density which is not available in Uniswap.
This repo is in development.
Please stay tuned for our updates.
